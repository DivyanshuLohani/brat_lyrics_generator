    cd brat_lyrics_generator
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  **FFmpeg**:
    This project uses `moviepy` and `imageio-ffmpeg`. Usually, the binary is handled automatically, but ensure you have a working FFmpeg setup if you encounter issues.
